% usage:    s = s_index(u)   or   s = s_index(u,pmode) 
%
% u is an image (a 2D array = a Matlab matrix)
%
% available preprocessing modes are:
%
% pmode = 0             raw S index of u
% pmode = 1             S index of the periodic component of u 
% pmode = 2             S index of the 1/2,1/2-translated of u 
% pmode = 3 (default)   S index of the 1/2,1/2-translated 
%                       of the periodic component of u
%
% Default mode (pmode = 3) should be used, unless you want to work on very
% specific images that are naturally periodic or not quantized (see paper)
%
% note: this function also works for 1D signals (line or column vectors)
