This is a demonstration of the blind light field image quality assessment method described in:

Jianjun Xiang, Mei Yu, Gangyi Jiang, Haiyong Xu, Yang Song and Yo-Sung Ho. "Pseudo Video and Refocused Images
 Based Blind Light Field Image Quality Assessment", Accepted, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology.

You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please
refer to its original source (cite our paper).

=======================================================================
An exmaple ( Matlab codes and light field image) are provided to demonstrate how to use the package. 

1) You should run make_RefoImag.m and generate multiple refocuse images.

2) Run extract_features.m and you can get perceputal features.

If you have any question about the code, please contact to 1811082122@nbu.edu.cn

Thank you!
